# Beta-Showdown-Emulator
An attempt of replicating the Pokemon battle formula in minute detail in non-web based Javascript. Please keep in mind that this is not an attempt at making a Pokemon emulator: rather a replication of the battle calculator and initial battle process for the free use of other websites.

Note: This is NOT the actual file, if you thought so. This is justa little readme so that you know what's going on.
